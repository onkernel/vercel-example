## What's this?

The general chat agent is powered by AI SDK and Assistant UI. We provide it a few tools that allow it to control a web browser hosted on kernel. You can extend the chat bot with more tools by reading these [docs](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling). 

Because this project is powered by AI SDK you can also turn this chatbot into a MCP client by following these [docs](https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/mcp-tools).
